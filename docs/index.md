This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, awakening my home with automations. I hope this will help you inspire on the way to built your own smart home.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!!attention "Beware of changes"
    I constantly improve my home. It evolves as I add new devices and services. It's changing as my daily routines are changing.

    Please, keep in mind **this documentation might be outdated** in covering some details. However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs. Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

- [Hardware](./hardware) that powers my home.
- [Home Assistant](./home-assistant/introduction) configuration.
- [Resources](./resources) for inspiration.

## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Limitations

I'm renting my apartment. My landlord handles fixing stuff in my home, covering all the expenses. The only downside is that I can't change anything in my home.

I can't disassemble anything and use custom switches or sockets. It means I can change only easily accessible parts, like bulbs.

## Future Plans

In the nearest future, my main focuses are:

- Migrating to Docker images. This will allow me to install custom software on my Raspberry Pi. Though I will be responsible for maintenance and backing up.
- Installing Plex on the server with an external HDD for storing media.

I have a [public Notion board](https://www.notion.so/denysdovhan/f09ea06da5db4cfa84d3ca50417b93b2?v=5fccab53c2fd4ac188ee0b92c2ca1cb9) with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.
