This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, awakening my home with automations. I hope this will help you inspire on the way to built your own smart home.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!!attention "Beware of changes"
    I constantly improve my home. It evolves as I add new devices and services. It's changing as my daily routines are changing.

    Please, keep in mind **this documentation might be outdated** in covering some details. However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs.

Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

[Software](./software/system){: .md-button }

## What's inside?

My home setup for those who are too lazy to read everything:

- [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as a home server.
- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for home automations.
- [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) for Zigbee devices.
- Reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) for SSH and Samba access.
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) for blocking ads within home network.
- [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-media-server) with an external hard drive for hosting movies and TV series.
- [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) for downloading new media to the hard drive.
- [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) for password management (Rust implementation of [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)).

## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Limitations

I'm renting my apartment. My landlord handles fixing stuff in my home, covering all the expenses. The only downside is that I can't change anything in my home.

I can't disassemble anything and use custom switches or sockets. It means I can change only easily accessible parts, like bulbs.

## Future Plans

I have a [public Notion board][notion-board] with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.
