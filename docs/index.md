# Welcome to my Smart Home!

Beware of changes!

## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. To keep track of growing my smart home. To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. To help other enthusiasts inspire. I'm often asked about my smart home setup. Now I can give people a link to the documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Future Plans

- Migration to Docker.
